				<p>Space calls to you! And adventure awaits! Why, you too can be piloting a ship through space in mere moments, joining a fleet of other such adventurers wandering the vast reaches of the galaxy! Explore strange worlds and phenomenon. Engage in epic battles! Turn a profit off of trade! And of course work on improving your ship!</p>

				<h2 id="aboutGame">About.</h2>
				<p>Captain’s Log is a narratively driven RPG played on pen and paper and with <a href="http://twitter.com/captainsloggame" target="_blank">Twitter as your GM</a>. Don’t worry though, you will get your chance to roll some dice as well! Captains log takes place in real time, and consequences are severe! So you may embark on a journey that will last you years, or simply a couple of days.</p>
			</div>
			<!-- what you need section -->
			<div class="contentBlock half">
				<h2 id='whatYouNeed'>What You Need.</h2>
				<p>As you travel through the universe, various situations will present themselves. Every event will have different ways that it can be approached, whether by cunning, running, or all out combat! To get started you only need a 6-sided die (don’t have one? You can click ours for a roll anytime!), a print-out of the character sheet, and some paper, or a print out of the Captain’s Log.</p>

					After you have printed out your character sheet, you need to design your captain and build your first ship! Sadly, you start with a pile of junk, not even registered to be on the cosmic highway! Your systems are all unreliable and you never quite know what is going to happen. Lucky for you however, you’ve been saving money from your gig at that burger joint, and have enough to upgrade one system!
					<em>All systems start at 0 (Zero), except your Hull which starts at 3,  you may choose ONE (1) system (other than Hull) to start with a value of 1 (One). </em>

				<h2 id="playingTheGame">Playing the Game.</h2>
				<p>
					To play, follow <a href="http://twitter.com/captainsloggame" target="_blank">@CaptainsLogGame on Twitter</a>. Everyday, multiple events will occur. Whenever you see an event in your feed, the game is on! If you miss events, or are away for a while, no worries! That just means you were either not paying attention, or were just sitting still in space, wasting time.
					<br /><br />
					Tweets come in the format of events, each with a description and some possible ways of approaching it. Sometimes, there will also be a reward (Rew)! Or other consequences!
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="contentBlock">
				<h4 class="clearRight">Normal Events</h4>
				<p>A common event may look like this</p>
			</div>
			<div class="tweet">
				<p>A Rac-a-pa-taaara ship approaches; it powers up its weapons and locks on to your ship! C:0 E:1 L:-1</p>
			</div>
			<div class="contentBlock">
				<p>
					You may choose any one of the shown stats (here Combat (C), Engines (E), and Luck (L)) to work through the encounter. Decide how you are going to approach the issue and then roll a 6-sided die for you and then again for the opponent. For your roll, add your value for that stat to the roll, and for your opponent, add the number that appeared after the letter for that stat.
				</p>
				<p class="threeCol">
					<strong>Your number is higher:</strong> You win! And a marvelous triumph it is! You also get any Reward (Rew) listed in the event.
				</p>
				<p class="threeCol">
					<strong>Your numbers are the same:</strong>  Nothing gained, but nothing lost either. You end in a draw, and move forward.
				</p>
				<p class="threeCol">
					<strong>Your number is lower:</strong> Regardless of the events that transpired. Something happened and your ship loses 1 Hull. (If your ship’s <a href="#zeroHull" class="scrollLink">Hull is at zero</a> it is destroyed and you must start a new ship!				</p>
			</div>
			<!-- shops -->
			<div class="contentBlock">
				<h4 class="clearRight">Shop Events</h4>
				<p>Sometimes, you will encounter shops! Shops will potentially sell items, or buy/sell cargo!<br /><br />A shop may look something like this. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="tweet">
				<p>You browse the goods at a small shop in orbit around a space station. Buy: Laser Pistol *P+1* $:190 Cur</p>
			</div>
			<div class="contentBlock">
				<p>
					In this example, you may either remove 190 currency from what you have (you MUST have at least 190 Currency). If you do add Laser Pistol to your list of items and add +1 to the current value of your Politics stat.
					<br /><br />
					If you purchased Cargo. Add it to your Cargo (note: Do NOT increase the value of your MC (Max Cargo), unless the item told you to). You cannot have more Cargo (C) than your Max Cargo (MC).
					<br /><br />
					If the shop lets your hire a Crew Member, this works much in the same way as items, except you should list them under the Crew Members section instead.
					<em>You cannot lose items, so you don’t need to remember what gives you what, but they are fun to talk about in your Captain’s Log.<br /><br />Crew Members CAN die, but you still get to keep the stat bonus they gave you. If you die, reduce your hull to Zero.</em>

				<h2 id="logEntry">After Events (Log Entry)</h2>
